<!-- explain here why are you multidisciplinary -->
		<p>
			I’m a multidisciplinary Senior UX designer currently living in Ottawa, Canada with my wife and two kids. Over the years I have worked with companies to help them connect with their customers through UX research, user centered design and collaboration. Perpetually curious, passionate about UX, with 15+ years of experience as a designer, I have a background as a graphic designer creating visual assets for different digital products. I have collaborated with teams designing and developing B2B web applications, e-commerce websites, games, and mobile apps.
		</p>
		<p>
			I work well with product managers, designers, developers, and other stakeholders evaluating user needs, defining design strategies and implementing meaningful design experiences.

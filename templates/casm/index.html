		<p>The Canada Aviation and Space Museum is Canada's national aviation history museum. The museum's collection contains a wide variety of civilian and military aircraft, representing the history of Canadian aviation from the pioneer era before the First World War up to the present day.<br /><br /> Through a case study the museum learned that a vast majority of visitors were interested in the interior of the aircraft and cockpits. This app augments the physical experience at the museum through a digital solution. Using high definition images of the cockpits we created a panoramic view of each cockpit. This app was built for iOS (iPhone and iPad).</p>

		<p>On the panoramic view visitors can interact with the cockpits by swiping on the screen, or turning around while holding the mobile device up. Pinching on the screen allows zoom in and out. Hotspots (+) provide aditional information and facts about the aircraft and specific information about the examples at the museum.</p>

		<p>Floating islands were illustrated representing different areas of the planet, they were accessible as the players progressed in the game. The area of the surface was calculated using a grid. Each square in the grid contained another grid of 9x9 squares. Each of these squares were equivalent in size to the main character.</p>

		<h4>Trees</h4>
		<p>Some areas on the islands had spots with tree 'fossils'. These could be respawn and grown into adult trees. On adult stage trees attracted different species (NPCs) that help players to collect materials and currency needed in the game. Other trees were grown or discover through different game mechanics.</p>

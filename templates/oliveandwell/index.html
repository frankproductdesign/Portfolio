		<p>Olive and Well is a Gourmet Foods Tasting Shop specializing in the most flavorful Extra-Virgin Olive Oils and Balsamic Vinegars from around the world. Their physical store is located in Chicago, Illinois. At the store, customers are able to taste their premium Olive Oils and Balsamic Vinegars before making their selection. Oils and vinegars are bottled from the same Italian Fusti (stainless steel tank) that they sample at the store. Aspects of the website design reflect on this idea, products are displayed with an emphasis on the flavour rather than the packaging.</p>

Server side and shopping-cart functionality coded by Iroel Perez. This is a redesign of the current live version (wwww.oliveandwell.com) for future release.</p>

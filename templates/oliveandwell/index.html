		<h4>Olive and Well responsive website design.</h4>

		<p>Olive and Well store is located in Chicago, Illinois. At the store, customers are able to taste their premium olive oils and balsamic vinegars before making their selection. Oils and vinegars are bottled from the same Italian Fusti (stainless steel tank) that they sample at the store. Aspects of the design reflect on this idea, products are displayed with an emphasis on the flavour rather than the bottle itself.</p>

		<p>I designed and coded this application almost entirely, except the server side and shopping-cart functionality which were coded by Iroel Perez. The current live version (wwww.oliveandwell.com) was a necessary release, it has been through a series of iteration, and it'll be replaced with this new design.</p>

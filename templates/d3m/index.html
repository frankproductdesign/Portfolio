		<p>D3M is a collaboration solution online tool built to help technicians, project managers, sales reps, engineers, design network topology, rack and floor plan diagrams all while auto-generating project inventory, quotes, proposals and documentation. <br />For more information visit <a href="http://www.d3mnetworks.com" target="_blank">d3mnetworks.com</a></p>
		
		<p>In this project I worked together with the D3M team implementing new features, enhancing exisiting functionality, and redesigning the overall user experience through UX research, prototyping and iterating on solutions.</p>

		<p>The initial step working with the D3M team was evaluating the existing app, identifying issues with the existing user experience, and defining a strategy. During this phase we also conducted some research, did a competitive analysis, listen to interviews, and watch users working with the app in real time.</p>
		<p>Areas we identified needed improvement;<br />
		Onboarding process - the initial step was conversome, users were dropping off before completing the sign up process.<br />
		Tools in the app to build and design different diagrams were not intuitive. Users had issues identifying how to use different tools.<br />
		Inconsistencies in the UI throughout the app; mix of CSS styles resulting in elements with the same functionality having different looks or different ways of interaction.</p>
		<p>The app was initially built without an specific design direction; a ‘remapping’ of the app was required to understand the overall information architecture, and user flow.</p>

		<h1>Prototypes</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>Prototypes were created in Adobe XD. During the design phase some prototypes were shared with existing users to validate new features, usability, and gather feedback for new iterations.</p>

		<p>Redesigning onboarding. This process focus on identifying the main type of users that will interact with this section of the app, understanding their goals, and re-evaluating why, how and when content is presented to the users.</p>

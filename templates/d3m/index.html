		<p>D3M is a collaboration solution online tool built to help technicians, project managers, sales reps, engineers, design network topology, rack and floor plan diagrams all while auto-generating project inventory, quotes, proposals and documentation. <br />For more information visit <a href="http://www.d3mnetworks.com" target="_blank">d3mnetworks.com</a></p>
		
		<p>In this project I worked together with the D3M team implementing new features, enhancing exisiting functionality, and redesigning the overall user experience through UX research, prototyping and iterating on solutions.</p>

		<p>The initial step working with the D3M team was evaluating the existing app, identifying issues with the existing user experience, and defining a strategy. During this phase we also conducted some research, did a competitive analysis, listen to interviews, and watch users working with the app in real time.</p>
		<p>Areas we identified needed improvement;<br />
		Onboarding process - the initial step was conversome, users were dropping off before completing the sign up process.<br />
		Tools in the app to build and design different diagrams were not intuitive. Users had issues identifying how to use different tools.<br />
		Inconsistencies in the UI throughout the app; mix of CSS styles resulting in elements with the same functionality having different looks or different ways of interaction.</p>
		<p>The app was initially built without an specific design direction, we did a ‘remapping’ of the app to understand the existing information architecture, and user flow. This exercise also allowed us to identify and reduce long branches, and identify dead ends.</p>

		<h1>Prototypes</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>Prototypes were created in Adobe XD. During the design phase some prototypes were shared with existing users to validate new features, usability, and gather feedback for new iterations (Designed for desktop usage).</p>

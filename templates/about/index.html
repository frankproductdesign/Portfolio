		<h1>Some Technical Info</h1>
			<br/>
		<p>
			I’m proficient with most Adobe design tools, but for the last few years I’ve been using Sketch to design and build prototypes. I like to code (as a hobby), I prefer to host my own websites rather than use someone else platform. I know some Javascript, AngularJS (the old version). I work with CSS frameworks like Sass and Less. I’ve been learning React (still working on it). I do not write code for production, I’m not a front-end developer.

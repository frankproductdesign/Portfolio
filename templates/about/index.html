		<h1>Me</h1>
			<br/><br/>
<!-- explain here why are you multidisciplinary -->
		<p>
			Through my experience designing for a variety of interactive media formats I've learned the importance of storytelling and branding, as well as how to adapt to different creative processes and methodologies to deliver best practices results. I have collaborated with teams designing and developing B2B web applications, e-commerce websites, games, and mobile apps.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm always curious about how design integrates with the software development process. Ocasionally I code small personal projects in AngularJS (only front-end development), i.e. this website. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Passionate about my work individually and working with teams; product managers, designers, developers, and other stakeholders evaluating user needs, defining UX strategies and implementing the outcome into user-centered designs.

		<h1>Process</h1>
			<br/><br/>
		<h3>Research and Set Goals</h3>
			<br/>
		<p>Before jumping into the design of the project, competitive and user-centered research is done to understand the target audience. Determine the goals of the project, and define a design direction.</p>
			<br/><br/>
		<h3>Sketch and Prototype</h3>
			<br/>
		<p>Sketch as many solutions as possible, select a few and refine. Depending on the scale and type of project, create prototypes in Adobe XD or Sketch, and prototype the design in code in the case of websites.
		</p>
			<br/><br/>
		<h3>Test and Collect</h3>
			<br/>
		<p>If a prototype can convey the design solution’s intent, users can test it. Gather user feedback and translate these insights into new solutions.</p>
			<br/><br/>
		<h3>Simplify and Iterate</h3>
			<br/>
		<p>Evaluate test results and iterate. Post-launch A/B tests and analytics determine further refinement needs.</p>
